# Pattern

A vanilla JavaScript router utilizing the HTML5 history API. Compatible with modern browsers only (ES6+).

Pattern will assign global variables on URL change and look for a function to call (examples below).

## Initialize

```
Pattern.init(); // Change URL with pushState eg. history.pushState(null, null, 'about');
```

## Examples

http://example.com/page?id=1  
This URL will look for a function called ```pageLoad()```, create a global variable called ```window.id``` with a value of ```1``` and assign ```'page'``` to the ```window.section``` global variable.

http://example.com/?id=2&page=5  
This URL will look for a function called ```homeLoad()``` (```'home'``` is used when no section is defined), create a global variable called ```window.id``` with a value of ```2```, a global variable called ```window.page``` with a value of ```5``` and assign ```'home'``` to the ```window.section``` global variable.

## Advanced

Your app can include a function called rewriteLoad() which will be called if there is no load function for a section eg. if the url is http://example.com/page and there is no pageLoad() function in your app then rewriteLoad() is called instead. This is useful if you would like to include a dynamic slug in your URL.

### Example

```
function rewriteLoad() {
    console.log(window.section);
}
```
